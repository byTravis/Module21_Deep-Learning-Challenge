## Background
The nonprofit foundation *Alphabet Soup* wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With machine learning and neural networks, I'm using the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by *Alphabet Soup*.

From *Alphabet Soup*’s business team, I have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from *Alphabet Soup* over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

- **EIN** and **NAME—Identification** columns
- **APPLICATION_TYPE** — Alphabet Soup application type
- **AFFILIATION** — Affiliated sector of industry
- **CLASSIFICATION** — Government organization classification
- **USE_CASE** — Use case for funding
- **ORGANIZATION** — Organization type
- **STATUS** — Active status
- **INCOME_AMT** — Income classification
- **SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS** — Special considerations for application
- **ASK_AMT** — Funding amount requested
- **IS_SUCCESSFUL** — Was the money used effectively

## Approach

This project was initially created in [Google Colab Project](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oVZ4ZpVErVYIB_9UTXLzWDW00broKoRK?usp=sharing).  A copy has been downloaded to GitHub for easy reference.


**Data Preprocessing**
- I dropped the *EIN* and *NAME—Identification* columns as they have no relevance to what we're evaluating
- I reduced the number of values in *APPLICATION_TYPE* and *CLASSIFICATION* by categorizing smaller segments into an "other" label.
- I expended categorial variables with pd.get_dummies()
- I'm using the *IS_SUCCESSFUL* column as our target for X
- I kept all of the other datapoints to be evaluated for Y
- I split the data into training ad testing datasets.
- I scaled the training and testing features using StandardScaler before fitting it to the model.


**Compiling, Training & Evaluating**

- I created the first model based on the starter code's outputs.  (Loss: 0.55914705991745, Accuracy: 0.7302623987197876)
- I'd like to achieve a higher accuracy of 75%, so I created 3 variations in hopes of increasing the accuracy and reducing the loss.
    - *Optimization Attempt 1* (Loss: 0.5743629932403564, Accuracy: 0.728396475315094)
        - Increase number of epochs from 100 to 200
    - *Optimization Attempt 2* (Loss: 0.566865861415863, Accuracy: 0.728863000869751)
        - Increased nodes in layer one to 3 times the number of columns in dataset.
        - Increased nodes in layer two to 1/2 the number of nodes as layer one
    - *Optimization Attempt 3* (Loss: 0.580244243144989, Accuracy: 0.7292128205299377)
        - Changed the number of nodes in layer one to 120
        - Changed the number of nodes in layer two to 90.
        - Added a third layer with 30 nodes.

- Manual optimization  didn't provide better results.  I decided to try the Keras Tuner Library to see if can improve the results and see what it suggests for model parameters.
    - The results from the Keras Tuner had slightly better, however the suggested parameters didn't seem appropriate.

## Conclusion
The base model seemed to be the most efficient (Loss: 0.55914705991745, Accuracy: 0.7302623987197876).  I tried different optimization techniques, including expanding the number of epochs, number of neurons, and the number of hidden layers.  The resulting tweaks to the model resulted in minimal differences, but in general performed slightly poorer.  
I decided to run the Keras Tuner Library to see if I could improve my results and see what is suggested for settings.  However, the results of that test returned parameters that didn't seem appropriate.  Specifically, it suggested Tanh function.  It also suggested a 2 hidden layers with only 9 nodes, even though we have 44 columns of data.  There was only a slight improvement in the score (Loss: 0.5527703166007996, Accuracy: 0.7346938848495483), so I opted to keep my original model.  
With the tests I have run, I concluded that it is unlikely we can move the needle toward the 75% accuracy goal with our current dataset.  Perhaps increasing our data or amending our approach on appropriate data to train our model may improve our results.
